Galois Theory is a popular and one of the important theory in Abstract Algebra. It's foundation was laid by the French Mathematician \textit{Ã‰variste Galois} by determining the necessary and sufficient condition for solving a polynomial equation by radicals and thereby solving the problem that was open for 350 years old \cite{galois}.\\ \\
The core-part of the Galois Theory is the ``\textit{Fundamental Theorem} of Galois Theory'' \cite {hunger}  which links two main parts of Abstract Algebra; Field Theory and Group Theory. This is a profound result in Abstract Algebra.

\subsection{Approaches to the Theory}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Galois approached this problem by using the group of ``permutations of the roots'' \cite{galois}  of a polynomial equation. Only those permutations of the roots are considered which leaves any equation satisfied by the roots unchanged.

\item The modern approach is to use the \textbf{field extension} of the underlying field of the polynomial and examine the groups of automorphism of the extension field that fixes the underlying field.
\end{enumerate}
So, the Galois theory is the theory of field extensions.

\section{Structure of a Field Extension}
A field \(F\) is an extension field of a field \(K\) if the field \(K\) can be embedded into the field \(F\).  The structure of \(F\) is that it is a vector space over the field \(K\) \cite{hunger}

Let \(F=K(u)\) be an extension field of the field \(K\). Then \(F\) is a vector space over \(K\) generated by \(u\). We have \(u^n \in F\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\) because F is a field. As ``\(F\) is a vector space over \(K\)'' \cite{hunger}; \(F\) consists of all linear combinations of \(u^n \)'s, and the quotients of these linear combinations. A such linear combinations is: \(a_nu^n+a_{n-1}u^{n-1}+...+a_1u+a_0\) which is  given by the polynomial \(f(u)\), where \(f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0\).\\

So the structure of the extension field \(F=K(u)\) is:\\
\(F= \{\frac{f(u)}{g(u)} \;| \; f,g \in K[x],g(u) \neq 0\}\) \cite{hunger}.\\

\begin{theorem} \cite{hunger} [Existence of an Extension field]
If K is a field and \(f \in K[x]\) is a polynomial of degree \(n\),then there exists a simple extension field \(F=K(u)\) of K such that \(u\in F\) is a root of \(f\).
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Algebraic and Transcendental element}
\begin{theorem} \cite{hunger}
Let \(F\) be an extension field of a field \(F\).\\
A map \(\phi:K[X] \rightarrow K[u]\) where \(u \in F\) defined by \(\phi (f(x))=f(u)\)\\
i.e, \(\phi (a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n)= a_0+a_1u+...+a_nu^n\) is a ring homomorphism.
\end{theorem}

Thus \( K[x]\) and \(K[u]\) are homomorphic.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \(u\) is transcendental over \(K\) then \(K[u]\) is not a field and \(K[x] \cong K[u]\).
  \item If \(u\) is algebraic over \(K\) then, \(K[x] \ncong K[u]\) because \(Ker\phi\) is non trivial and we have,
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[i)] ``\(K(u) \cong K[u]\);
    \item[ii)] \(K(u) \cong K[x]/(f)\), where \(f \in K[x]\) is an irreducible monic polynomial of degree \(n \geq 1\);
    \item[iii)] \([K(u):K]=n\) and \(\{1_k,u,u^2,...,u^{n-1}\}\) is a basis of the vector space \(K(u)\) over \(K\)'' \cite{hunger}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem} \cite{hunger} [Isomorphism of Extension fields]
 Let K be a field.\\
 Then 'u' and 'v' are  roots of the same irreducible polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) if and only if there is an isomorphism of fields \(K[u] \cong K[v]\) which sends u onto v and is the identity on \(K\).
\end{theorem}

\section{Galois Group}
Let \(F\) be a field. ``The set \(AutF\) of all field-automorphisms \(F \rightarrow F \) forms a group under the function composition'' \cite{hunger}.\\[3mm]
\noindent
Let \(E\) and \(F\) be the extension fields of a field \(K\).\\
If a non-zero field-homomorphism \(\sigma : E \rightarrow F\) is a K-module homomorphism then\\
\(\sigma(k)=\sigma(k1_E)=k\sigma(1_E)=k1_F=k\).\hspace{7mm}
i.e, \(\sigma\) fixes \(K\) element-wise.\\
Conversely, if a field homomorphism \(\sigma : E \rightarrow F\) fixes K element-wise, then \(\sigma\) is a non-zero and for any \(u \in E\), we have, \(\sigma(ku)=\sigma(k)\sigma(u)=k\sigma(u)\)
i.e \(\sigma\) is a K-module homomorphism \cite{hunger}.
\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
  A field-automorphism \(\sigma \in Aut F\) which is also K-homomorphism is called K-automorphism. In other words, a field-automorphism \(\sigma \in Aut F\) that fixes K element-wise is called K-automorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
  The group of all K-automorphisms of \(F\) is called the Galois group of \(F\) over \(K\) and it is denoted by \(Aut_K^F\).
\end{definition}

\section{Galois Extension}
Let \(E\) be an intermediate field and \(H\) be a subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\), then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i)] ``\(H' = \{v \in F \; | \: \sigma(v)=v,\) for all \(\sigma \in H \}\)'' \cite{hunger} is an intermediate field of the extension field \(F\) of \(K\);
\item[ii)] ``\(E' = \{\sigma \in Aut_K^F \; | \; \sigma(u)=u,\) for all \(u \in E\}=Aut_E^F\)'' \cite{hunger} is a subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\).
\end{enumerate}

The field \(H'\) is called the fixed field of the subgroup H in F \cite{hunger}.

\subsection{Fixed Field}
We have,\\
\(H' \rightarrow\) fixed field and \(E' \rightarrow\) \(Aut_E^F\).\hspace{5mm} Let \(Aut_K^F = G\) then the field fixed by it is \(G'\). It is not necessary that the field fixed by \(G\) is \(K\) i.e, \(G'=K\).
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{example}
  For \(f(x)=x^3-2 \in Q[x]\). Let \(u \in F\) such that \(f(u)=0\) and let \(F=Q[u]\).Then
  \(G=Aut_Q^{Q(u)}={1}\) so, \hspace{5mm}\(G'=F \neq K\).
\end{example}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
Let \(F\) be an extension field of \(K\) such that the fixed field of the Galois group \(Aut_k^F\) is \(K\) itself. Then \(F\) is said to be a Galois extension of \(K\) or Galois over K.
\end{definition}

\section{Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{theorem} \cite{hunger}
  If \(F\) is a finite dimensional Galois extension of \(K\), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all intermediate fields of \(F\) over \(K\) and the set of subgroups of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[i)] the relative dimension of two intermediate fields is equal to the relative index of the corresponding subgroups. In particular \(Aut_K^F\) has order \([F:K]\);
  \item[ii)] \(F\) is Galois over every intermediate field \(E\), but \(E\) is Galois over \(K\) if and only if the corresponding subgroup \(E'= Aut_E^F\) is normal in \(G=Aut_K^F\).In this case \(G/E'\) is isomorphic to the Galois group \(Aut_K^E\) of \(E\) over \(K\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{2mm}
We already have a correspondence between the intermediate fields and the subgroup of Galois group.\\
That is to each intermediate field \(E\), there is a subgroup \(Aut_E^F\) and to each subgroup \(H\) there is a fixed field \(H'\). But this correspondence is one-to-one if and only if for each intermediate field \(E\), it satisfies \(E''=E\) and for each subgroup \(H\), it satisfies \(H''=H\).

\subsection{Closed Field and Subgroup}
\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
  Let \(X\) be an intermediate field or subgroup of the Galois group. \(X\) will be called \textbf{closed} provided \(X=X''\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma} \cite{hunger}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i)] If \(F\) is an extension field of \(K\), then there is one-to-one correspondence between the closed intermediate fields of the extension and the closed subgroups of the Galois group, given by \(E \rightarrow E' =  Aut_E^F\).
\item[ii)] If \(F\) is a finite dimensional Galois extension of \(K\), then all intermediate fields and all subgroups of the Galois group are closed and \(Aut_K^F\) has order \([F:K]\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\vspace{3mm}

\subsection{Stable Intermediate}
\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
  An intermediate field \(E\) of \(F\) over \(K\) is said to be stable intermediate if \(\sigma(E) \subseteq E\) for every \(\sigma \in Aut_K^F\) .
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma} \cite{hunger}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[i)] If E is a stable intermediate field of the extension, then \(E'=Aut_E^F\) is a normal subgroup of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) ;

  \item[ii)] if \(H\) is a normal subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\), then the fixed field \(H'\) of \(H\) is a stable intermediate field of the extension
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\vspace{3mm}

\subsection{Proof of the Fundamental Theorem}
\begin{proof}
From lemma 1 above, one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields and the subgroups follows \cite{hunger}. And from lemma 2 the next two statements of the theorem follows \cite{hunger}.
\end{proof}
\vspace{3mm}

\subsection{Applications}
The fundamental theorem links Field theory to Group theory. This allows us to use the tools of Group theory to solve the problems involving field theory. Solving a polynomial equation is a problem of field theory. We can use insights of Group theory to solve this problem of field theory which is discussed in some detail in next part of this thesis \cite{hunger}.


\subsection{Illustration of The Fundamental Theorem}
\begin{minipage}{0.68\textwidth}
  Let \(F\) be an Galois extension of a field \(K\). Let the towers of the intermediate fields of \(F\) over \(K\) be as follows:
  \[
    K \subset E \subset F
  \]
\noindent
  Let \(G\) be the Galois group of \(F\) over \(K\). Then its subsets are
  \[
    \{e\} \subset H \subset G
  \]
  Then the one-to-one correspondence is as shown:

  The intermediate fields are getting larger as we go from bottom to top as the fields are getting extended. But the subgroups are getting smaller.

\section{Insights to the Fundamental Theorem}

\subsection{Nature of a Number}
\textcolor{blue}{The nature of a number depends upon the underlying field.} \\
\(\sigma:\{a+b\sqrt{2}\} \mapsto \{a-b\sqrt{2}\}\) where \(a,b \in \mathbb{Q}\) is a field-automorphism of  \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) that fixes \(\mathbb{Q}\). This map \(\sigma \) is also denoted by \(\sqrt{2} \longmapsto -\sqrt{2}\). So, any polynomial equation over \(\mathbb{Q}\) satisfied by the number \(\sqrt{2}\) is also satisfied by the number \(-\sqrt{2}\). You can fluidly pass between these two numbers and the equation with a rational coefficient will not know. \textit{Hence the two numbers \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(-\sqrt{2}\) are algebraically same over \(\mathbb{Q}\).}\\

But the map \(\sqrt{2} \longmapsto -\sqrt{2}\) does not fix the field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) i.e does not fix itself. The only automorphism of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) is the identity map. So, you cannot pass \(\sqrt{2}\) for \(-\sqrt{2}\) for every equation with coefficients in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\). \textit{Hence the two numbers \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(-\sqrt{2}\) are not algebraically same over \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\).}

\subsection{Structure of a Field}
The structure of a field as an extension field over some field is mirrored in the structure of the ``group'' of  permutations of its elements that keeps the base field fixed. But these permutations are the symmetries of the field. \textit{So, the structure of field extension is equals to its own symmetry.}\\

The structure of a field is a \textbf{complicated} thing; specially if it is infinite. But the structure of a group is rather simple; especially if it is finite. So the Galois theory has fairly simplified the complicated thing in a very insightful and beautiful way.\\

Also Galois theory gives a new sights of study of fields which is ``study of fields via study of its automorphisms'' which are permutations of the field. That is\\[5mm]

Galois extension \(F\) of  \(K\) is a field for which the fixed field of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) is \(K\) itself \cite{hunger}.\\
But for what extension field \(F\) of \(K\) the Galois group keeps the ``base field \(K\)'' fixed? What is the structure of Galois field extension and how do we construct(obtain) it?


\section{Structure of a Galois Extension}
Since, for \(F=K(u)\), any \(\sigma \in Aut_K^F\) is ``completely determined'' \cite{hunger} by its action on \(u\). Any algebraic Galois extension of \(K\) is generated by all roots \(u\) of a polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) \cite{hunger}.

\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
  Such a minimal field \(F\) where a polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) ``splits into linear factors'' and thus ``contains all roots of \(f(x)\)'' is called a splitting field of \(f\) over \(K\).
\end{definition}
Thus, an algebraic Galois extension is going to be characterized by ``a splitting field of a polynomial over the base field'' \cite{hunger}.
\vspace{3mm}

\begin{theorem} \cite{hunger} [Existence of a Splitting field]
  If \(K\) is a field and \(f \in K[x]\) has degree \(n \geq 1\), then there exists a splitting field \(F\) of \(f\) with \([F:K] \leq n!\).
  \end{theorem}

\subsection{Algebraic Closure of a Field}
``A field \(F\) is said to be algebraically closed if every non-constant polynomial \(f \in F[x]\) has a root in \(F\)'' \cite{hunger}.
For example the field of complex number \(\mathbb{C}\) is algebraically closed.\\[3mm]

\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
An extension field \(F\) of a field \(K\) is said to be algebraic closure of \(K\) if,
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i)] F is algebraically closed and,
  \item[ii)] F is algebraic over \(K\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


So, \(\mathbb{C}\) is algebraically closed field but is not an algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{Q}\) because \(\mathbb{C}\) is not algebraic over \(\mathbb{Q}\) \cite{hunger}.
But \(\mathbb{C}\) is an algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{R}\).\\
This shows algebraic closure is an special case of a splitting field.

\section{Separable Extension}
``An irreducible polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) is said to be separable if in some splitting field of \(f\) over \(K\) every root of \(f\) is a simple root'' \cite{hunger}.\\
An algebraic element \(u \in F\) is said to be ``separable over \(K\) provided its irreducible polynomial is separable''\cite{hunger}.
\begin{definition} \cite{hunger}
  If every element of \(F\) is separable over \(K\), then \(F\) is said to be a separable extension of \(K\).
\end{definition}
\vspace{3mm}
\noindent
\textbf{Characteristic of a Separable extension}
\begin{remark} \cite{hunger}
  Every algebraic extension field of a field of characteristic \(0\) is separable.
  \end{remark}
If a polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) is separable over \(K\) then it has no multiple roots in any splitting field of \(f\) over \(K\) \cite{hunger}. ``This shows that an irreducible polynomial in \(K[x]\) is separable if and only if its derivative is nonzero'' \cite{hunger}. This holds true for every field of characteristic zero \cite{hunger}.

\section{Galois extension and Splitting Field}
\begin{theorem} \cite{hunger}
  \(F\) is algebraic and Galois over \(K\) if and only if \(F\) is separable over \(K\) and \(F\) is a splitting field over \(K\) of a set \(S\) of polynomials in \(K[x]\).
  \end{theorem}

This proves the \textbf{Generalized Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory},\\
which sates the \textit{Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory} still holds if the extension field \(F\) is not finite dimensional as-well i.e, if ``\(F\) is algebraic and Galois over \(K\)'' \cite{hunger}.
