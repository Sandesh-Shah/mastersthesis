\section{Galois Group}
Let \(F\) be a field. The set \(Aut F\) of all field-automorphisms \(F \rightarrow F \) forms a group under the function composition.\\ \\
Let \(E\) and \(F\) be extension fields of a field \(K\).\\
If nonzero field-homomorphism \(\sigma : E \rightarrow F\) is a K-module homomorphism then\\
\(\sigma(k)=\sigma(k1_E)=k\sigma(1_E)=k1_F=k\).\hspace{7mm}
i.e, \(\sigma\) fixes \(K\) elementwise.\\ \\
Conversely, if field homomorphism \(\sigma : E \rightarrow F\) fixes K elementwise, then \(\sigma\) is a nonzero and for any \(u \in E\),\(\sigma(ku)=\sigma(k)\sigma(u)=k\sigma(u)\)
i.e \(\sigma\) is a K-module homomorphism.\\ \\
A field-automorphism \(\sigma \in Aut F\) which is also K-homomorphism is called K-automorphism. In other words, a field-automorphism \(\sigma \in Aut F\) that fixes K elementwise is called K-automorphism.\\ \\
The group of all K-automorphisms of \(F\) is called the Galois group of \(F\) over \(K\) and is denoted by \(Aut_K^F\).

\section{Galois extension}
Let \(E\) be an intermediate field and \(H\) be a subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\), then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i)] \(H' = \{v \in F | \sigma(v)=v, for all \sigma \in H \}\) is an intermediate field of the extension field \(F\) of \(K\).
\item[ii)] \(E' = \{\sigma \in Aut_K^F | \sigma(u)=u, for all u \in E\}=Aut_E^F\) is a subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\).
\end{enumerate}

The field \(H'\) is called the fixed field of subgroup H in F.

\subsection{Fixed Field}
We have,\\
\(H' \rightarrow fixed field \) \hspace{5mm} \(E' \rightarrow Aut_E^F\)\\
Let \(Aut_K^F = G\) then the field fixed by it is \(G'\).\\
It is not necessary that the field fixed by \(G\) is \(K\) i.e, \(G'=K\).\\

\textbf{Example}\\
For \(f(x)=x^3-2 \in Q[x]\). Let \(u \in F\) such that \(f(u)=0\) and \(F=Q[u]\).Then
\(G=Aut_Q^{Q(u)}={1}\) so, \(G'=F \neq K\).\\[2mm]

\textbf{Galois extension}\\
Let \(F\) be an extension field of \(K\) such that the fixed field of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) is \(K\) itself. Then \(F\) is said to be a Galois extension of \(K\) or to be Galois over \( K\).

\section{Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory}

If \(F\) is a finite dimensional Galois extension of \(K\), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all intermediate fields of the extension and the set of subgroups of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i)] the relative dimension of two intermediate fields is equal to the relative index of the corresponding subgroups; in particular \(Aut_K^F\) has order \([F:K]\);
  \item[ii)] \(F\) is Galois over every intermediate field \(E\), but \(E\) is Galois over \(K\) if and only if the corresponding subgroup \(E'= Aut_E^F\) is normal in \(G=Aut_K^F\);in this case \(G/E'\) is isomorphic to the Galois group \(Aut_K^E\) of \(E\) over \(K\).
  \end{enumerate}

  We already have a correspondence between the intermediate fields and the subgroup of Galois group given by the fixed fields and the corresponding subgroups of the intermediate field \(E\), \(Aut_E^F\).
  i.e, to each intermediate field \(E\), there is a subgroup \(Aut_E^F\) and to each subgroup \(H\) there is a fixed field \(H'\).\\[2mm]
  But this correspondence is one-to-one if and only if \(E''=E\) and so on.

  \subsection{Closed Field and Subgroup}
  We have,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[i)] \(F'=1\) and \(K'=G\);
  \item[ii)] \(1'=F\);
    \end{enumerate}

    If \(F\) is Galois over \(K\) then by definition, \(G'=K\). Since \(K'=G\) we have \(K=K''\) if and only if \(F\) is Galois over \(K\).\\

    Let \(X\) be an intermediate field or subgroup of the Galois group. \(X\) will be called \textbf{closed} provided \(X=X''\).\\[3mm]

    \textbf{Theorem}. If \(F\) is an extension field of \(K\), then there is one-to-one correspondence between the closed intermediate fields of the extension and the closed subgroups of the Galois group, given by \(E \rightarrow E' =  Aut_E^F\).\\[3mm]

    \textbf{Lemma}. Let \(F\) be an extension field of \(K\), \(L\) and \(M\) intermediate fields with \(L \subset M\), and \(H\), \(J\) subgroups of Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) with \(H<J\).
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[i)] If \(L\) is closed and \([M:L]\) finite, then \(M\) is closed and \([L':M']=[M:L]\);
    \item[ii)] if \(H\) is closed and \([J:H]\) finite, then \(J\) is closed and \([H':J']=[J:H]\);
      \item[iii)] if \(F\) is a finite dimensional Galois extension of \(K\), then all intermediate fields and all subgroups of the Galois group are closed and \(Aut_K^F\) has order \([F:K]\).
      \end{enumerate}

      \subsection{Stable Intermediate}
      \textbf{Lemma}. Let \(F\) be an extension field of K.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item[i)] If E is a stable intermediate field of the extension, then \(E'=Aut_E^F\) is a normal subgroup of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\);
        \item[ii)] if \(H\) is a normal subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\), then the fixed field \(H'\) of \(H\) is a stable intermediate field of the extension.
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Proof of the Fundamental Theorem}
        From the above section there is one-to-one correspondence between closed intermediate fields of the extension and closed subgroups of the Galois group. But in this case all intermediate fields and all subgroups are closed. Thus follows Statement(i) of the theorem.\\[2mm]

        \(F\) is Galois over \(E\) since \(E\) is closed. \(E\) is finite dimensional over \(K\) since \(F\) is and hence algebraic over \(K\). Consequently, if \(E\) is Galois over \(K\), then \(E\) is stable.
        \(E'=Aut_E^F\) is normal in \(Aut_K^F\). Conversely if \(E'\) is normal in \(Aut_K^F\), then \(E''\) is stable intermediate field. But \(E=E''\) since all intermediate fields are closed and hence \(E\) is Galois over \(K\).\\[2mm]

        Suppose \(E\) is an intermediate field that is Galois over \(K\). Since \(E\) and \(E'\) are closed and \(G'=K\)(F is Galois over K), we have \(|G/E'|=[G:E']=[E''=G']=[E:K]\). So, \(G/E'=Aut_K^F/Aut_E^F\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \(Aut_K^F\). But by first part of the theorem, \(|Aut_K^E|=[E:F]\)(since E is Galois over K). This implies \(G/E'=Aut_K^E\).
