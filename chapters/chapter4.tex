Galois extension \(F\) of  \(K\) is a field for which the fixed field of the Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) is \(K\) itself.
But what field \(F\) keeps the base field \(K\) fixed? What is the structure of Galois field and how do we construct(obtain) a Galois field?


\section{Splitting Field}
Since, for \(F=K(u)\), any \(\sigma \in Aut_K^F\) is completely determined by its action on \(u\). So, the algebraic Galois extension is generated of all roots \(u\)of a polynomial. Such a minimal field \(F\) where a polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) splits into linear factors and thus contains all roots of \(f(x)\) is a splitting field of \(f\) over \(K\). And the algebraic Galois extension is to be characterized by the splitting field.\\[2mm]

\textbf{Existence of a Splitting field} \hspace{3mm}
If \(K\) is a field and \(f \in K[x]\) has degree \(n \geq 1\), then there exists a splitting field \(F\) of \(f\) with \([F:K] \leq n!\).

\subsection{Algebraic Closure of a Field}
A field \(F\) is said to be algebraically closed in every nonconstant polynomial \(f \in F[x]\) has a root in \(F\).
For,example the field of complex number \(C\) is algebraically closed.\\[2mm]

An extension field \(F\) of a field \(K\) is said to be algebraic closure of \(K\) if,
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i)] F is algebraically closed and,
  \item[ii)] F is algebraic over \(K\).
\end{enumerate}

So, \(C\) is algebraically closed field but is not an algebraic closure of \(Q\) because \(C\) is not algebraic over \(Q\).
But \(C\) is an algebraic closure of \(R\).\\

This shows algebraic closure is an special case of a splitting field.

\section{Separable Extension}
An irreducible polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) is said to be separable if in some splitting field of \(f\) over \(K\) every root of \(f\) is a simple root.\\[2mm]

An algebraic element \(u \in F\) is said to be separable over \(K\) provided its irreducible polynomial is separable. If ever element of \(F\) is separable over \(K\), then \(F\) is said to be a separable extension of \(K\).\\[2mm]

\textbf{Characteristic of a Separable extension}\\
Every algebraic extension field of a field of characteristic \(0\) is separable.\\[2mm]

It is clear that a separable polynomial \(f \in K[x]\) has no multiple roots in any splitting field of \(f\) over \(K\). This shows that an irreducible polynomial in \(K[x]\) is separable if and only if its derivative is nonzero. Hence every irreducible polynomial is separable if \(char K = 0\).


\section{Galois extension}
\(F\) is algebraic and Galois over \(K\) if and only if \(F\) is separable over \(K\) and \(F\) is a splitting field over \(K\) of a set \(S\) of polynomials in \(K[x]\).\\[2mm]

This proves the \textit{Generalized Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory},\\
which sates the \textit{Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory} still holds if the extension field \(F\) is not finite dimensional as-well i.e, if \(F\) is algebraic and Galois over \(K\).
