Galois fields are the finite fields. They can be completely characterized in terms of splitting fields and the Galois group of an extension of a finite field by a finite field is shown to be cyclic.\\

\begin{definition}[Prime Fields]
Let \(F\) be a field and let \(P\) be the intersection of all subfields of \(F\). Then \(P\) is a field with no proper subfields. This field \(P\) is called the Prime subfield of \(F\).
\end{definition}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(charF=p(prime)\), then \(P\cong {\mathbb{Z}}_p\).
\item If \(charF=0\), then \(P\cong \mathbb{Q}\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
A field \(F\) is a finite field with \(p^n\) elements if and only if \(F\) is a splitting field of \(x^{p^n} - x\) over \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).\\
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If \(F\) is a finite dimensional extension field of a finite field \(K\), then \(F\) is finite and is Galois over \(K\). The Galois group \(Aut_K^F\) is cyclic.
\end{theorem}
