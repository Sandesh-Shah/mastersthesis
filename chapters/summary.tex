The Galois theory that begun in the 19th century due to the french mathematician \textit{Ã‰variste Galois} is still a relevant field of research today. Over the 200 years this theory has found its development as a unifying theory of the two main theories: Group Theory and Field theory. It has found its applications in both pure and applied mathematics; where-ever ``Field Theory'' has anything to do.\\
Many concepts of Abstract algebra, Algebraic number theory, Algebraic geometry, etc heavily rely on Galois theory, and the computer science relies heavily on Galois field.
