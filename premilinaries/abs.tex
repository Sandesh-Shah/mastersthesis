In this thesis entitled \textcolor{blue}{\thetitle}, a brief but complete theory of Galois is developed in the first part. Then its applications are explored in the second and third part. The second part deals with the applications in Algebra where as the third part deals with the applications in computer science. The application in algebra is the famous classic problem of non-existence of a ``formula'' for a polynomial of degree greater than four. The application in computer science is the application of ``Galois field'' in Coding theory and Cryptography.\\

The new research in this thesis is the computation of Galois group of a fifth degree and of a seventh degree polynomial and extension of Galois group from single variable polynomial to multi-variable polynomial.
