In this thesis entitled \textcolor{blue}{\thetitle}, first the Galois Theory is introduced and the fundamental theorem of Galois Theory is proved. Then using the frame-work of the fundamental theorem the applications of the Galois theory is explored. First it is applied to compute the Galois Groups of Polynomials of various degrees. Two new examples of polynomials of degree more than are also explained and the concept of Galois group of a single variable polynomial is extended to the Galois group of a multi-variable polynomial. Then it is applied to solve the non-existence of a ``formula'' to solve a polynomial equation of a degree five or above. Finally  theory of Galois field is applied to the computer science in the coding theory and cryptography. In Coding theory it is applied to the Error-Correcting codes and in Cryptography it is applied in Block Cipher algorithm.
